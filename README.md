Image classification using convolutional neural network

CIFAR-10 is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. 
It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and 
consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, 
with 6000 images per class.
1. Download CIFAR-10 dataset from (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
2. Preprocess the images. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. 
3. Use convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
4. Train a convolutional neural network on all the samples.
5. Test Model and check model accuracy.
